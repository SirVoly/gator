# Gator 

An RSS feed aggregator in Go, called "Gator"

It's a CLI tool that allows users to:

*	Add RSS feeds from across the internet to be collected
*	Store the collected posts in a PostgreSQL database
*	Follow and unfollow RSS feeds that other users have added
*	View summaries of the aggregated posts in the terminal, with a link to the full post
*	RSS feeds are a way for websites to publish updates to their content. You can use this project to keep up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!

This project was build with the intention of hands-on practice in GO, PostgreSQL, sqlc, goose and HTTP Requests and RSS feeds.
